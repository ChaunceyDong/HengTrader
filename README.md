> A project for algorithmic trading of cryptocurrencies.

From now on, you can automate the process of lossing money. 😼

## Introduction 
The purpose of this project is to maximize the separation and independence of the "trading strategy," "backtesting," "order placement," and "data" components. This allows us to focus on the strategy itself when designing and backtesting trading strategies, simplifying the interactions between the strategy and other parts.

Additionally, I plan to directly develop the trading component based on the ccxt API. This way, even enthusiasts with minimal experience can easily run their own trading bot (and potentially lose money automatically🐽) without the need for significant additional effort.
