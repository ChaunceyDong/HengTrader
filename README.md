> A project for algorithmic trading of cryptocurrencies.

From now on, you can automate the process of lossing money. 😼
现在起，你可以将输钱过程自动化了！

## Introduction 
The purpose of this project is to maximize the separation and independence of the "trading strategy," "backtesting," "order placement," and "data" components. This allows us to focus on the strategy itself when designing and backtesting trading strategies, simplifying the interactions between the strategy and other parts.

Additionally, I plan to directly develop the trading component based on the ccxt API. This way, even enthusiasts with minimal experience can easily run their own trading bot (and potentially lose money automatically🐽) without the need for significant additional effort.


# Strcuture
Does such a simple project really need an introduction to the file structure?


## Next steps
This project has just begun completely... The recent main task is to complete the code for the backtesting framework. Then, there's also the need to adjust the file structure and improve comments and such. QAQ.
这个项目还完全刚刚开始……最近的主要工作是完成回测框架的代码。然后还要调整文件结构，完善注释之类的。QAQ
